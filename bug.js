This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or a prop before it has been initialized. This commonly happens during component mounting or when dealing with asynchronous operations.  For example, if you have a state variable `data` that is fetched asynchronously using `useEffect`, attempting to access `data` within the render method before the fetch has completed will result in an error. Similarly, if you pass a prop to a component that is not yet available, this will also cause the error.
